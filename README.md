Demo of an AWS serverless website using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

Website bits shamelessly cribbed from http://squirrelbin.com/ demo site.

Also be sure to take a look at the [Apex tool](https://medium.com/@tjholowaychuk/introducing-apex-800824ffaa70#.v1ibrao3n) which abstracts away most of the details of the AWS API Gateway and Lambda interfaces so you can focus on the code rather than on the details of setting up the interfaces.
